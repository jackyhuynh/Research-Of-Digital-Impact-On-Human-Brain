# A guild to Multi-Threading vs. Multi-Processing & Process Synchronization
Research paper on Multi-Threading vs. Multi-Processing applies to Operating System & Application. The research analyzes the fundamental of multiprocess and multithreading programming. The report paper also explains the basics of how operating system functions, and OS Scheduler Algorithms. I also implement the Producer-Consumer Problem using Conditional Variables to explain issues in OS Scheduler. The research paper can be used as a good reference for multithreading Engineers, or embedded System Engineers when developing Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing applications.

## Technology:
- Java
- Multithreading
- Data Structures
- Multi-Process
- Producer/Consumer Problems

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Eclipse IDE: The Eclipse IDE is famous for our Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but we have several pretty cool IDEs, including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, and more. 
- Java Runtime Environment and Java Virtual Machine: Java software for your computer, or the Java Runtime Environment, is also referred to as the Java Runtime, Runtime Environment, Runtime, JRE, Java Virtual Machine, Virtual Machine, Java VM, JVM, VM, Java plug-in, Java plugin, Java add-on or Java download.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.
Download and Install Java (Java Runtime Environment or Java Virtual Machine)
* [Java for Windows](https://java.com/en/download/) - we should download and install JVM before the Eclipse IDE 
Download and Install Eclipse IDE
* [Install Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE yet, here's how to get started.
* [Install Net Bean IDE](https://netbeans.org/features/index.html) - You can use either Eclipse IDE or Net Bean IDE, not need both. If you haven't downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE yet, here's how to get started.

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- Start ConditionalVariable.java
- Tested complete successfully.

## Built With

* [Java Virtual Machine](https://java.com/en/download/)
* [Eclipse IDE for Windows](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
