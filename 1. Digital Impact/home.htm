			With the development of technology <b>digital devices</b>. (smart phones, smart watches, tablet, 
			video game consoles, televisions and computers) appear in every aspect of children lives. Halpert
			claimed that <em>“92% of children play games”</em> on smart phones when they were two, and “1/3 of 
			children own a full feature tablet” in United States (2015). Studies show negative impacts, such as 
			kids's creativity, imagination and development, are gowning <i>since they start using smart devices early</i> 
			(Straker at al., 2010). The use of digital devices is growing and making 
			negative effects on children’s health. Thus, children, especially those under ten, shouldn’t use 
			or own digital devices.

			Early activities would also help children developing their movement skills (walking, running, climbing, crawling,
			throwing and holding object, ...) <i>(Zask et al, 2012)</i>. 
			</li>
			<li>
			Playing with other kids outside will also help children improve
			their coordination and socialization. “Increasing children’s physical activity is a worldwide health priority” 
			<i>(Zask et al, 2012).</i>
