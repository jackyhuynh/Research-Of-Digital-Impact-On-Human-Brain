			<li>
			Children's health system may not develop properly if they sit all day and stay focus on digital screens 
			(Straker at al., 2010). 
			</li>
			<li>
			The use of smart devices during the day can bring significantly less sleep, less 
			talk and slow react to children (Taveras et al., 2008).
			</li>
			<li>As a result, this could affect their social 
			interaction, and learning manner. Studies found that kids who are sleep less than ten hours a day are more
			likely to develop obesity later in their childhood than those who sleep the recommended hours 
			(Taveras et al., 2008).
			</li>
			</ul>
   		<li id="DamageChildren'sPhysicalHealth"><b>Cause Nearsightedness, Farsightedness or Astigmatism In Preschooler:</b><br/> 
			<ul>
			<li>
			Long hours looking on digital screen may cause nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism in preschooler. 
			Researches show most people who use digital screen for two or more continues hours daily will certainly develop 
			Computer Vision Syndrome or Digital Eye Strain (Kozarsky, 2017).</li>
			<li>
			Also, According to American Optometric Association, 
			kids have eyes problems have difficulties in playing sports, studying, or playing with others (n. d.). 
			Allowing children
			to use digital devices early could cause eyes problems or permanent damages their eyes.</li>
			</ul>
   		<li id="DamageChildren'sPhysicalHealth"><b>Adverse Musculoskeletal:</b> <br />
			<ul>
			<li>
			Intensive computer use cause “adverse musculoskeletal” and other issues such as joint pains, headaches, 
			and sleep's issues in children: 
			Those symptoms have been shown to be related to the duration of computer use (Straker et al., 2010)</li>
			</ul>
   		<li id="DamageChildren'sPhysicalHealth"><b>Play Videogames cause Mentol Issue:</b> <br />
			<ul>
			<li>
			An Oxford University study show that kids who doesn’t play video games are less happy, active and 
			socialize compare to those who play video games up to an hour a day (CBS News, 2014). The researchers
			divided the sample, around five thousand kids, into three groups. First group who played video games 
			(Nintendo Wii, Sony Play Stations, or computer-based games) up to an hour a day show less “hyperactivity”
			, friendship and emotional problems than the others group. Furthermore, first group was claimed to be the 
			happiest group and have the “highest levels of social-ability”. The second group is the one who didn’t play
			 video game at all or played up to three hours a day. This group show neither benefits or un-benefits. 
			The third group is the one who played video games for three hours or more, and this group showed <em>harmful
			 effects</em> from playing video games (CBS News, 2014).
