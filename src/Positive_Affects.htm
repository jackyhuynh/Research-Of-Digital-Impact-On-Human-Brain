		<li><b><u>Play Videogames make Kids happier:</u></b> <br />	
			<b>Pros:</b><br />
			<ul>

			<li>
			An Oxford University study show that kids who doesn’t play video games are less happy, active and socialize 
			compare to those who play video games up to an hour a day (CBS News, 2014). </li>

			<li>The researchers divided the sample,
			around five thousand kids, into three groups. First group who played video games (Nintendo Wii, Sony Play Stations,
			or computer-based games) up to an hour a day show less “hyperactivity”, friendship and emotional problems than the 
			others group. Furthermore, first group was claimed to be the happiest group and have the “highest levels of social-ability”. 
			The second group is the one who didn’t play video game at all or played up to three hours a day. This group show neither 
			benefits or un-benefits. The third group is the one who played video games for three hours or more, and this group showed 
			harmful effects from playing video games (CBS News, 2014).</li>

			</ul>
			
			<b>Cons:</b>
			<ul>
			<li> 
			Playing games under one hours could be good for kids. However, it is hard to train children follow the rules of using their 
			devices under one hour. 
			</li> 

			<li> 
			I myself experience this. When I was fourteen years old, me and all my classmates was told by our 
			parents to play videos games less than an hour a day. I followed the rules for few weeks. Later, I got addicted in online games 
			and couldn’t stop myself. I usually lied to my parents that I had group studies after school, yet I went to online game stores. 
			This was not only me and my classmates but also most of the boys in my middle school. I was forced to stop by my parents when 
			they figured out that I went to game stores instead of school.  During my high school, I saw many people drop off from school 
			because of video games. </li> 

			<li> 
			In South Korea, game addiction is illegal and was listed as illegal addiction compare to sex, alcohol, 
			and drug addictions (Halpert, 2015).

		<li><b><u>Developing communication between education communities:</u></b> <br />
			<b>Pros:</b><br />
			<ul>
			<li>
			Another advantage of digital devices is children can use device’s applications to broaden their knowledge,
			share their ideas, and develop communication between education communities (Glick, 2016).</li> 
			<li>
			For example, 
			a middle school in Minnesota encourage and instruct their student to publish new applications to create 
			advancements in food supply system. These applications are using information and technologies on the 
			internet to create better methods for gardening.
			</li>
			<li>
			Smart devices are not only improving children’s knowledge 
			but also bring them closer by using messenger and video call (Glick, 2016).
			</li><br />
			</ul>
			
			<b>Cons:</b>
			<ul>
			<li>
			Although smart devices could be good tools for children’s educations, they may not need that
			when they are too young. </li>
			<li>
			Instead of using digital devices, they should engage in physical activities because
			physical activities are more important in developing children’s health system.</li>
			<li>
			Researches show that children 
			who engage in physical activities for twenty minutes to an hour a day develop better reading developments, social 
			communication skills, academic skills, and behavior than the one who sit all day (Glick, 2016).</li>
			<li>
			In New South Wales 
			of Australia, a study of five hundred and sixty children about object control skills had showed: Outdoor activities 
			positively impact children's development and their physical ability (Zask et al. 2012).</li>
			<li>
			Early activities would also help children developing their movement skills
			(walking, running, climbing, crawling, throwing and holding object, ...) .
			(Zask et al, 2012).</li>
 			<li>Playing with other kids outside will also help children improve their coordination and socialization.
			 “Increasing children’s physical activity is a worldwide health priority” (Zask et al, 2012).</li>
			Creating physical activity habits early help children have better reading developments, social communication, 
			academic tests, mathematic and behavior than the children who sit all day (Glick, 2016).</li>
			</ul>
		<hr />
		<li><b><u>Another advantage of using smart devices early was claimed is to improve children health.</u></b> <br />
			<b>Pros:</b><br />
			<ul>
			<li>
			By sending them text messages to children personal devices for vaccine and appointments reminders. or educating children to
			use applications that track what they eat and their activities during the day (University of Kansas, 2017). </li>
			<li>These applications 
			will monitor the time that children use their smart devices. Then it will send messages to their phones or tablets to remind 
			them get off their digital devices and do physical activities. These recommendations also base on many factors such as children 
			health’s situation, body weight and height. (University of Kansas, 2017).</li>
			</ul>

			<b>Cons:</b>
			<ul>
			<li>
			However, children may access to other harmful contents without parents notice since they can access to their devices anytime. </li>
			<li>
			According to Halpert, the average of age that children watch porn is eleven years old and will continue to decline in the future 
			(2015). The best way to avoid this situation is denying children to own or use digital devices.</li>
			<li>
			Pornographic website found it
			easier to target young children. In fact, “Porn sites get more visitor than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined” (Halper, 2015).</li>
			</ul>
		<hr />
		<li><b><u>Conclusions:</u></b><br /></li>
			<ul>
			<li>Allowing children to play video games and watch TV is a popular trend nowadays of busy parents. Dr. Kabala, a pediatric resident 
			at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, claimed most parents who participate in her survey, allow their children to use smart 
			devices couple hours a day (Haelle, 2016). Smart devices will keep the kids busy while their parents take care of their stuffs
			. Some parents believed that digital devices will bring more benefit than harm to their kids. Dr. Kabala also stated, 
			"Although mobile devices are ubiquitous in young children's lives, we don't yet know the impact mobile devices can have on young children" (Haelle, 2016).</li>
